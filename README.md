Hi there 
My self M.Hemanth Krishna Reddy and my
Project is about food delivery website 
and it applications. Here is in brief
about our projectAn online ordering 
system is software that lets your 
restaurant accept 
and manage orders placed online.
An online food ordering system 
generally has two components – a website 
or app that allows customers to
view the menu and place an order, and 
an admin interface that enables the
restaurant to receive and fulfil
customer orders.Online food
ordering systems are a
great option for restaurants
looking to respond to a rapidly
changing operating environment – and
most are relatively easy to set up.
